# HN Special â€” A Hacker News extension

A theme and extension for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) that improves the look and feel and adds some interesting features.

This is a fork from https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/hn-special that slightly tweaks the light theme and makes it possible to upload on Firefox Add-ons store, at the cost of some features.
